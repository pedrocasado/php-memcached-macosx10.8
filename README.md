php-memcached-macosx10.8
========================

memcache.so and memcached.so compiled for PHP 5.3.14/5.4.4 on mac os x 10.8.4 using libmemcached-1.0.4 and libmemcached-0.44.

for some reason we were getting problems using php memcached session handler with libmemcached-1.0.4, that's why i had to compile the extension again using libmemcached-0.44.
